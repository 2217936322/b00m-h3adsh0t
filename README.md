## B00m-h3adsh0t! Aimbot &#x1F537;
* Game bot used in first-person shooting (FPS) games where players need to constantly move, think, strategize, and shoot enemies all at once
* Aimbot uses game data to shoot at the heads of energy targets
* Ex: *“Turn off the aimbot you noob K/D ratio hacker!"*

## Aimbot Neural Network &#x1F537;
* Trained by neural network (NN)
* **Customizable predictions and dynamic speed settings**
* Colored models 
* Engine-Aim:
  * Hook into the half-life game engine - uses ACTUAL game data to auto-aim without altering gaming files
  * Modifies memory of RAM half-life runs on 
  * Gathers information from current game and pixel location
* Select which FPS game you will use (Fortnite/CombatArms/League_of_Legends)
  
---

## Model Training Recognization  &#x1F537;
* Custom training mode 
* **Enter to train NN to detect objects for object recognition using computer vision algorithms** 
* Train with range of distances, lights, and angles for best possible recognition
* Name-tag display to detect players 
* Pixel memory hack
* Resolution range 

---


## How it Works  &#x1F537;
* Aimbot can be easily toggled on and off using the mouse or keyboard
* Recognizes game objects in a certain range, then aims at the objects
* Neural Network 
    * Program takes **multiple screenshots** to recognize objects 
    * Different distances, lights, angles for best possible recognition 
    * Output - program writes in **cfg file** 
      * Batch = 1
      * Subdivision = 1 for testing 
    * Graph of **Training/Validation Set**
      * x vs y 
      * Error Rate vs Number of Iterations in Training Set 
* Training depenencies - Trained files for games
    * **config.json file** - to change the resolution range for object recognition  
    * Train Files Folder
      * darknet folder/subfolders 
      * data or back up
      * GAME.names
      * GAME.cfg
      * GAME_last.weights 
      * GAME.weights

## Client Server Back-End Implementation &#x1F537;





---

## Game Statistics and Analytics &#x1F537;
* Player behavior anomalie detection 
  * Detected by statistically analyzing game events 
  * Data sent by client to  server by statistical detection systems
  * Add human element of supervision system (community/admin team looks over player statistics) 
  * Unusual player behavior leads to clientside creating then uploading a gamer report
* Pattern detection systems 
  * Scan the player's hard drives for known cheat code or programs
  * Scan the player's system memory for known cheat code or programs
  * Labor-intensive to constantly track down cheats and update detection patterns
* Anti–cheat method 
  * Guaranteed to work on all end–user system configurations
  * Reduce the amount of false positives


---

## User Privacy &#x1F537;
* End–users concerned with privacy issues
* VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) accessing browsing history
* Man-in-the-middle attack
  * Security of game circumvented by intercepting or manipulating data in real-time while transit from the client to the server or vice versa 
  * Performed on client machine itself or via external communication proxy
* "Never trust the client" common saying with game developers 
* User privacy compromsed with packet interception/manipulation 



---

## Player Attacks &#x1F537;
* Select button to attack and enable/disable training mode
* Custom zooming control with scroll wheel 
* Custom cursors 
* Laser sight
* Trigger bot
* Auto shoot/rapid fire 
  * Most fps games limit the rate weapons are fired regardless of how fast a player presses buttons
  * Binding the firing button to the scroll wheel of a mouse
  * Macro setting that will simulate rapid key presses automatically
* Auto clicker for semi automatic weapons 
* Dynamic recoil control  
  * Remove gun revoil game element
  * control bullet spread
* Move speed
* Ammo count
* Player radar

## Other Glitches/Modifications  &#x1F537;
* Wall hacks
  * Glitches with game surfaces
  * Graphics driver modifications that ignore depth checking
  * draw all objects on the screen
* Reduced flash 
* Transparent buildings, ceilings, obstacles, and trees
  * Remove visual elements of the game 
* Display enemy lines 
* Extrasensory perception
