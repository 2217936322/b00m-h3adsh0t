## B00m-h3adsh0t! Aimbot General &#x1F537;
* Computer game bot used in first-person shooting (FPS) games
* Uses game data to shoot at the heads of energy targets
* Game shooters need to constantly move, think, strategize, and shoot enemies all at once
* Ex: *“Turn off the aimbot you noob K/D ratio hacker!"*

## Aimbot Neural Network &#x1F537;
* Colored models 
* B00m-h3adsh0t! Engine-Aim:
  * Hook into the half-life game engine - uses the ACTUAL game data to auto-aim
  * Very dynamic and customizable 
  * Positive virus 
  * Does not alter gaming files 
  * Modifies memory of RAM half-life runs on 
  * Gathers information from current game and pixel location
* Trained by neural network (NN)
* **Customizable predictions and speed settings**
* Select which FPS game you will use (examples below)
  * Fortnite
  * CombatArms
  * League of Legends

## Common Anti-Cheat Software &#x1F537;
* GameGuard
* PunkBuster
* Valve Anti-Cheat 
* EasyAntiCheat

## Model Training Recognization  &#x1F537;
* Custom training mode 
* **Enter to train NN to detect objects for object recognition using computer vision algorithms** 
* Train with range of distances, lights, and angles for best possible recognition
* Name-tag display to detect players 
* Pixel memory hack
* Resolution range

## B00m-h3adsh0t! - How it Works  &#x1F537;
* Aimbot can be easily toggled on and off using the mouse or keyboard
* Recognizes game objects in a certain range, then aims at the objects
* Neural Network 
    * Program takes **multiple screenshots** to recognize objects 
    * Different distances, lights, angles for best possible recognition 
    * Output - program writes in **cfg file** 
      * Batch = 1
      * Subdivision = 1 for testing 
    * Graph of **Training/Validation Set**
      * x vs y 
      * Error Rate vs Number of Iterations in Training Set 
* Training depenencies - Trained files for games
    * **config.json file** - to change the resolution range for object recognition  
    * Train Files Folder
      * darknet folder/subfolders 
      * data or back up
      * GAME.names
      * GAME.cfg
      * GAME_last.weights 
      * GAME.weights

## Player Attacks &#x1F537;
* Select button to attack and enable/disable training mode
* Custom zooming control with scroll wheel 
* Custom cursors 
* Laser sight
* Trigger bot
* Auto shoot/rapid fire 
  * Most fps games limit the rate weapons are fired regardless of how fast a player presses buttons
  * Binding the firing button to the scroll wheel of a mouse
  * Macro setting that will simulate rapid key presses automatically
* Auto clicker for semi automatic weapons 
* Dynamic recoil control  
  * Remove gun revoil game element
  * control bullet spread
* Move speed
* Ammo count
* Player radar

## Other Glitches/Modifications  &#x1F537;
* Wall hacks
  * Glitches with game surfaces
  * Graphics driver modifications that ignore depth checking
  * draw all objects on the screen
* Reduced flash 
* Transparent buildings, ceilings, obstacles, and trees
  * Remove visual elements of the game 
* Display enemy lines 
* Extrasensory perception
