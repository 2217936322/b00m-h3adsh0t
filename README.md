## Aimbot General &#x1F537;
* Trained by NN (Neural Network)
* **Customizable** predictions and speed settings 
* Select which FPS game you will use

---

## Model Recognization  &#x1F537;
* Custom training mode 
* Enter to train NN to detect objects for **Object Recognition** 
* Train with range of distances, lights, and angles for best possible recognition
* Name-tag display to detect players 
* **Pixel memory** hack
* Resolution range 

---


## How it works  &#x1F537;
* Recognizes game objects in a certain range, then aims at the objects
* Neural Network 
    * Program takes **multiple screenshots** to recognize objects 
    * Different distances, lights, angles for best possible recognition 
    * Output - program writes in **cfg file** 
      * Batch = 1
      * Subdivision = 1 for testing 
    * Graph of **Training/Validation Set**
      * x vs y 
      * Error Rate vs Number of Iterations in Training Set 
* Training depenencies - Trained files for games
    * **config.json file** - to change the resolution range for object recognition  
    * Train Files Folder
      * darknet folder/subfolders 
      * data or back up
      * GAME.names
      * GAME.cfg
      * GAME_last.weights 
      * GAME.weights

---

## Player Attacks &#x1F537;
* Select button to attack and **enable/disable training mode**
* Custom **zooming control** with scroll wheel 
* Custom cursors 
* Laser sight
* Trigger bot
* **Auto shoot :)** 
* Auto clicker for semi automatic weapons 
* Dynamic recoil control

## Other Glitches  &#x1F537;
* Wall glitches
* Reduced flash 
* Transparent buildings, ceilings, obstacles, and trees
* Display enemy lines
